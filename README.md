## Motivation

The goal of this project was to make full use of the skills learned in HTML/CSS/VanillaJS. This served as the ultimate application of vanilla JS for me which will help me better grasp new technologies like ReactJS and NextJS! I am not the creator of the HTML/CSS and API portions of this project and focused solely on the Vanilla JS portion so learn how to effectively apply vanilla JS as well as gain a more firm understanding of it.
